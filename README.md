## Project Title

Side Quest Week 2: Interactive Blob

---

## Description

> Based on the foundation of Example 03, this version allows the blob to change its color from blue to green while moving, and transform to a rougher spiky red appearance when hitting the platforms whether on the sides or underside.
> It applies how semantic colors communicate emotions and signify states and functions to users.

---

## Interaction Instructions

> Press and hold `A/D` or `←/→` to move the blob horizontally.
> Press `W`, `SPACE`, or `↑` to jump.
> Land on platforms.
